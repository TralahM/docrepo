Contributing Guidelines
=======================

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!  Contributions are
welcome and very much appreciated.  If this is your first time contributing to a
Free and Open Source Software project, consider reading `How to Contribute to
Open Source`_ in the Open Source Guides.  Additionally, to maximize the chance
that your contribution will be accepted and minimize wasted effort, consider the
following guidelines:


Tests Must Pass
===============

In order for a pull request to be accepted, it must build and test successfully
on the continuous integration systems.  GitHub displays a build status
indicator on the pull request.  If the build is broken, please fix it (or add a
comment if you think the pull request is not the cause of the breakage).

The CI build runs several linters and tests.  These can be run locally by
invoking ``tox``.  Disabling linter rules using inline configuration is
acceptable, where justified.  Disable specific rules where possible (i.e.
``# noqa: F401`` rather than just ``# noqa``).


Add Tests Where Reasonable
==========================

If the pull request fixes a bug or adds a feature, consider adding a test to
ensure the bug does not reoccur and the feature works as expected.  If testing
is not straightforward, feel free to submit the pull request without tests.
How to test and whether testing is required can be discussed during the review
process.


Consider Discussing Big Changes First
=====================================

If the desired change is large, complex, backwards-incompatible, can have
significantly differing implementations, or may not be in scope for this
project, opening an issue to discuss the change before writing the code can
avoid frustration and save a lot of time and effort.

This is not a hard requirement.  If you'd rather start discussing a big change
with a proposed implementation, feel free.  Be aware that the code may be
rejected outright, or require many changes before it is acceptable.

issue_template = """
Please remove all of this template but the relevant section below, and fill in
each item in that section.

## Feature Request

### Feature Description

Describe in detail the feature you would like to see implemented, especially
how it would work from a user perspective and what benefits it adds. Your description
should be detailed enough to be used to determine if code written for the feature
adequately solves the problem.

### Use Cases

Describe one or more use cases for why this feature will be useful.

### Testing Assistance

Indicate whether or not you will be able to assist in testing pre-release
code for the feature.

## Bug Report

When reporting a bug, please provide all of the following information,
as well as any additional details that may be useful in reproducing or fixing
the issue:

### Version

{0} version, as reported by ``{0} --version``

### Installation Method

How was {0} installed (provide as much detail as possible, ideally
the exact command used and whether it was installed in a virtualenv or not).

### Supporting Software Versions

The output of ``python --version`` and ``virtualenv --version`` in the environment
that {0} is running in, as well as your operating system type and version.

### Actual Output

```
Paste here the output of {0} (including the command used to run it),
run with the -vv (debug-level output) flag, that shows the issue.
```

### Expected Output

Describe the output that you expected (what's wrong). If possible, after your description,
copy the actual output above and modify it to what was expected.

### Testing Assistance

Indicate whether or not you will be able to assist in testing pre-release
code for the feature.

__IMPORTANT:__ Please take note of the below checklist, especially the first two items.

# Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] All pull requests must include the Contributor License Agreement (see below).
- [ ] Code should conform to the following:
    - [ ] pep8 compliant with some exceptions (see pytest.ini)

      writing tests for the code, feel free to ask for help or submit the PR without tests.
    - [ ] Complete, correctly-formatted documentation for all classes, functions and methods.
    - [ ] documentation has been rebuilt with ``tox -e docs``
    - [ ] All modules should have (and use) module-level loggers.
    - [ ] **Commit messages** should be meaningful, and reference the Issue number
      if you're working on a GitHub issue (i.e. "issue #x - <message>"). Please
      refrain from using the "fixes #x" notation unless you are *sure* that the
      the issue is fixed in that commit.
    - [ ] Git history is fully intact; please do not squash or rewrite history.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at musyoki.tralah@students.jkuat.ac.ke. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4,
available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html
